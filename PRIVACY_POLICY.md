# Privacy Policy for Record Time Label

**Last Updated:** 2024-05-24

This Privacy Policy describes how "Record Time Label" (the "Extension") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## 1. Information We Collect

To provide cloud synchronization features, we collect the following information:

*   **Authentication Information**: When you choose to log in, we collect information necessary to authenticate you.
    *   **Google Login**: We receive your basic profile information, including your Google User ID and email address, as provided by Google's authentication service.
    *   **Email/Password Login**: We collect the email address you provide and a hashed version of your password. We never store your plain-text password.

*   **User-Generated Content**: All the data you create using the extension is stored to enable synchronization across your devices. This includes:
    *   Time labels (timestamps and descriptions).
    *   Folders you create to organize your labels.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Your information is used solely for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide Core Functionality**: To save, retrieve, and synchronize your time labels and folders across different browsers and devices where you are logged in.
*   **Authentication**: To identify you as a user and provide access to your stored data.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

*   Your authentication information and user-generated content are securely stored on Google's **Firebase** platform (Firestore and Firebase Authentication).
*   We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including using secure connections (HTTPS) and relying on the robust security infrastructure of Google Firebase.

## 4. Information Sharing and Disclosure

**We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any third parties for their commercial purposes.**

Your data is only accessed by the Extension to provide the synchronization service to you.

## 5. Data Retention

You can delete your account and all associated data at any time from within the extension's settings. Upon account deletion, all your user-generated content and authentication information will be permanently removed from our Firebase database.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the extension or on its web store page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
